# Pandas-Challenge
As a whole I found this challenge to be easier than the previous. There was some confusion in the wording of a few of the questions and trying to determine exactly which 
data was to be extracted. 
Overall it does not appear that the budgets for the schools had a significant effect on the result of the test scores for each of school, I think most people would expect
higher budgets to result in better test scores.
There was a correlation between size of school and test scores with the small and medium schools performing better than the larger schools. Some additional information about
student to teacher ratios may also be useful for further analysis. 
The charter schools also appear to have better scores than the district schools over all categories evaluated. Additional evaluation in these categories would also 
be beneficial to help understand further if it is related to budget, class sizes or teacher performance.
